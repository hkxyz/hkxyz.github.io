<span class="firstletter">C</span>oncept of division of screen into multiple bars has been around and we've seen it on many websites and themes.




The Use Case of having two bars, and having one fixed, solid like 'ice', usually the left one, and having the other side  scrollable where all the website's content in focus goes flowing, changing, like 'water'... is used in some really cool themes.




Ice and Water is a minimal, text-based and super flexible take on this philosophy. And the Futura Std Medium font, black text on white background to give it that 'Night's Watch' feeling.


Currently only for big screens, I'm working on the responsiveness. For that, the idea is to design a layout which can shift the left sidebar to top and right to bottom once the screen size turns mobile, which it presently not behaves like and screws up on small screen, which got my first GitHub issue by the way.
